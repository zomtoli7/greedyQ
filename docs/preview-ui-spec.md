# greedyQ Preview UI Specification

[한국어](./preview-ui-spec(kor).md)

**Status:** Draft normative specification
**Applies to:** self-contained preview and web-native respondent renderer

## 1. Purpose

The preview is the primary instrument-review surface. It must let a researcher experience the questionnaire as a respondent while making otherwise invisible state inspectable. A prose study summary is supporting documentation, not a substitute.

The canonical renderer has exactly three modes: `desktop`, `mobile`, and `preview`. The respondent entry point detects desktop versus mobile from current viewport and pointer capabilities at runtime and must not use user-agent brand sniffing as the authoritative signal. Preview mode renders independent desktop and mobile respondent sessions simultaneously. All three modes use the same fixed parser, validator, normalized AST, question components, routing engine, and state semantics. Responsive presentation may differ; question meaning, stored values, validation, navigation, randomization, and lifecycle behavior may not.

The preview has two strictly separated layers:

- **Respondent layer:** the questionnaire exactly as a participant should experience it.
- **Researcher layer:** preview-only controls, state inspection, route forcing, and test evidence.

Researcher controls must be visually marked and must never appear in production respondent mode.

## 2. Default layout

Preview uses two labelled viewport frames: a flexible desktop frame and a 390 CSS-pixel mobile frame. Each frame owns an independent virtual session. When the preview workspace itself is narrow, stack the frames without changing their forced respondent modes. Production desktop uses a centered respondent card no wider than 760 pixels. Production mobile removes decorative card elevation, uses the available width, increases touch targets to at least 44 CSS pixels, and keeps navigation reachable without covering questions.

The persistent top bar contains the greedyQ wordmark, a conspicuous `RESEARCHER PREVIEW` badge, page progress, and an accessible progress value. Avoid application chrome, decorative dashboards, nested cards, or controls unrelated to completing the questionnaire.

Use a calm neutral canvas, a white questionnaire surface, one restrained primary color, clear 1-pixel boundaries, and modest elevation. The minimum content width is 320 CSS pixels. At 200% zoom, content must reflow without horizontal scrolling except wide matrices, which receive their own labelled scroll region.

## 3. Respondent page anatomy

Render, in order:

1. study title and stable page ID eyebrow in preview only;
2. one page heading;
3. concise introductory or stimulus content;
4. questions in declared order;
5. one page-level validation summary when needed;
6. Previous and primary Continue/Submit actions; or
7. a clearly identified terminal outcome with no outgoing production action.

Use one primary action per page. Previous is visually secondary. Disable Previous only when history is empty or policy forbids it. Do not disable Continue merely because required answers are empty; activation must reveal an actionable error and move focus to the first invalid question.

## 4. Question presentation

- Use native semantic controls whenever possible.
- Every control has a persistent visible label. Placeholder text is never the only label.
- Mark required questions with text or an accessible label, not color alone.
- Single choice uses a `fieldset`, `legend`, and native radios. The whole visible option row is clickable.
- Each preview option shows its stored value beneath the display label. Production respondent mode hides stored values.
- Select controls use an unselectable empty prompt and preserve the display/stored distinction.
- Discrete scales use native radios, display meaningful endpoint labels, and remain keyboard operable. Do not use an unlabeled custom range slider for categorical Likert data.
- Matrix questions use real table headers and unique radio-group names per row. On small screens, prefer one row at a time or a labelled horizontal-scrolling table; never shrink text below the base size.
- Optional text areas say `Optional` in visible help or label text. Do not imply that open text is required.
- Hidden questions are removed from the focus order. When `clear_on_hide` applies, the preview clears the hidden answer and records that event.

## 5. Validation and feedback

Validate authoritatively on forward navigation. Identify the first invalid question in text, set `aria-invalid=true`, connect the message with `aria-describedby`, focus the invalid control or its legend, and scroll it into view. Preserve all other valid answers.

Errors explain how to fix the problem. Never rely on red color alone. A corrected response removes its stale error. Validation must cover required values, numeric ranges, complete required matrix rows, and declared cross-field rules.

## 6. Progress and navigation

Progress is based on the reachable respondent path, not the raw count of every condition page. It must never move backwards during ordinary forward navigation. Preview page jumping may change it and must be visibly identified as researcher behavior.

Back navigation preserves valid answers and the persisted assignment. Refresh/resume restores the last committed page, answers, condition, history when safe, and lifecycle state. A reset control clears only preview-local state after an explicit action.

## 7. Researcher controls

The researcher panel provides:

- deterministic condition selection;
- page and terminal-outcome jump controls;
- current page, reachable next page, condition, lifecycle state, and visit history;
- every answer with question ID, display label, stored value, and type;
- hidden-answer clearing events and validation events;
- copyable state snapshot;
- reset;
- scenario runner result summary when automated cases are bundled; and
- a visible statement that external writes and production redirects are disabled.

Changing a forced condition resets condition-dependent answers and returns to the assignment boundary unless the researcher explicitly chooses a raw page jump. Debug controls must not mutate production services.

## 8. Preview safety

The preview runtime is fixed trusted code. Survey-authored JavaScript, inline event handlers from study content, `eval`, dynamic code construction, remote scripts, external fonts, analytics, network writes, and production redirects are prohibited. Study content is escaped or sanitized before insertion. Secrets and service-role credentials must never be embedded.

The default Content Security Policy should allow only local document resources required by the self-contained artifact. The preview displays conspicuous draft text for unresolved consent, IRB, redirect, or data-policy fields and cannot mark those items approved.

## 9. Accessibility baseline

Target WCAG 2.2 AA. Use semantic HTML before ARIA, visible keyboard focus, logical heading order, native keyboard behavior, sufficient contrast, labelled status/error messages, and a reduced-motion mode. Interactive targets should be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, with larger option rows preferred. Radio groups follow native browser behavior and the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices radio-group interaction model.

Automated checks do not replace keyboard and screen-reader review. At minimum, manually test Tab/Shift+Tab, arrow and Space behavior in radio groups, Enter/Space on disclosures and buttons, focus after validation, zoom/reflow, and high-contrast or forced-color presentation.

## 10. Responsive and visual acceptance

Test at 320×568, 390×844, 768×1024, 1280×800, and 1440×900 CSS pixels, plus 200% browser zoom. Verify no clipped labels, overlapping actions, unreachable debug controls, unreadable matrices, unexpected horizontal page scroll, or content hidden by sticky regions.

The UI should feel like a credible research instrument: quiet, spacious, direct, and free of decorative product-marketing elements. Preview tooling may be denser, but the respondent layer must remain visually dominant.

## 11. Required scenario suite

Every complete reference study must exercise:

1. happy-path completion in every condition;
2. required-field failure for every required question type;
3. consent refusal without research answers;
4. every screen-out route;
5. every terminal outcome, including technical error;
6. every show/hide branch and hidden-answer clearing;
7. every skip route and priority decision;
8. Previous plus answer revision;
9. refresh/resume before and after assignment;
10. assignment invariance across navigation and refresh;
11. display-label/stored-value accuracy;
12. complete matrix capture;
13. withdrawal/deletion-request behavior;
14. production redirect suppression;
15. absence of network writes and secrets;
16. keyboard-only completion;
17. responsive viewport and zoom checks; and
18. malformed model failure with a clear researcher-facing diagnostic.

## 12. Review evidence

`interactive_preview_reviewed` requires the preview version and hash, scenario-suite result, viewport/accessibility review result, unresolved deviations, researcher identity or decision reference, and confirmation timestamp when available. Opening or generating the preview alone is not approval.
